# Full Stack Blog Website

In this project, I will make a Full-stack Blog app using Next JS, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. In this, full-stack website project I will create a forntend, Backend, and admin panel. 

On this website, I will display the blog post. I will create an admin panel dashboard using Next js to upload and manage our blog post. I will also create the backend for our APIs. Using these backend API I can save the blog post on our mongodb database and we can also fetch the data from mongodb database and display the blog post on your website.

To design this blog website I will use tailwind css so that I can easily design our components layout in next js project.
